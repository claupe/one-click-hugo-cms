intro:
  heading: The story
  text: >-
    It all started with one Canadian guy going to Malawi for an Engineers
    Without Borders internship. He kept in touch with the community that hosted
    him and started supporting it through an educational fund. Support was
    recently diversified to purchase trees through the The Forest Landscape
    Restoration Strategy. In 2019, Seed Malawi is sharing coffee from the Mzuzu
    hills with donors from all around the world to put them in touch with what
    Malawi has to offer.

  heading: Our values
  text: >-
    Coffee is an amazing part of human culture but it has a dark side too – one
    of colonialism and mindless abuse of natural resources and human lives. We
    want to turn this around and return the coffee trade to the drink’s
    exhilarating, empowering and unifying nature.
